# [Janis](https://www.Janis.ai) - Enhance Slack For Customer Service

Janis turns Slack into powerful customer service software.  You can integrate Janis into bots you're building easily and then monitor your bots from Slack.  Janis will alert you when to take over live and open a channel for you to get 1 on 1 with your customer, then automatically resume your bot when you're done.

You can integrate Janis in minutes and it begins working immediately. 

### What you can do with Janis:
You can view a full list of features at (https://www.janis.ai).  This toolkit enables bot developers to integrate Janis into their conversational experience.


### What you need to get started:
* [Janis for Slack](https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=im:history,users:read,users:read.email,commands,chat:write:bot,chat:write:user,channels:read,channels:history,files:write:user,channels:write,links:read,links:write,bot&client_id=23850726983.39760486257)
* [Botpress with Messenger and/or Slack module installed](https://botpress.io/)

##### Operational Dependencies:
1.  You'll need an API key from Janis and for each Chatbot a Bot Token.  You can get both of those when you add Janis to Slack.
2.  A Messenger and/or Slack module set up in Botpress. 


### Installation
Installing modules on Botpress is simple. By using CLI, users only need to type this command in their terminal to add Janis module to their bot.
```bash
$ botpress install janis
```
It's also possible to install it through the Botpress UI in the modules section.


### Usage
Janis will immediately start alerting you when your bot has no response, and when your users say something with a negative sentiment. You can also set up custom alerts, such as when a user requests assistance.

##### Dial 0 to Speak With a Live Human Being:

Janis can trigger alerts to suggest when a human should take over for your Chatbot. To enable this, create an intent such as when a customer explicitly requests live assistance, and then include the following lines of code where your bot listens for this intent:

```javascript
// match an intent to talk to a real human
bp.hear({ type: 'message', text: 'human' }, (event, next) => {
  // let the user know that they are being routed to a human
  var responseText = 'Hang tight. A human is on the way.'
  if (event.platform == "facebook") {
    bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, responseText)
  } else if (event.platform == "slack") {
    bp.slack.sendText(event.channel.id, responseText)
  }
  // send a Janis alert to your slack channel
  // that the user could use assistance
  bp.events.emit('assistanceRequested', {platform: event.platform, raw: event.raw})
})
```


Go back to Slack and wait for alerts. That's it!
